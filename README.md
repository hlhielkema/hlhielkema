**🐈 Cat fact of the day:**
```
When a cat lifts its butt in the air when scratched, it is a sign that your feline is giving your pats an A+. However, if you have a female kitty who hasn't been spayed, "elevator butt" could be a sign that she's ready to mate. The proper name for this stance is lordosis, and cats adopt it when they're in heat.
```
