**🐈 Cat fact of the day:**
```
The myth that a cat has nine lives comes from their ability to jump and land from high places. The number 9 is believed by some to originate from William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet: "A cat has nine lives. For three he plays, for three he strays, and for the last three he stays."
```
