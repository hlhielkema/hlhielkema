**🐈 Cat fact of the day:**
```
The Egyptian Mau breed was saved from extinciton when Russian princess Natalie Trubetskaya was given a Mau that was imported from the Middle East. When she emigrated to New York City in 1956, she brought along three Mau cats. She used these kitties to establish the Fatima Egyptian Mau cattery, which produced many of the ancestors of today’s Egyptian Maus in America.
