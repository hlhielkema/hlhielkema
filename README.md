**🐈 Cat fact of the day:**
```
Bobtail cats owe their shortened tails to a natural genetic mutation that has appeared in cats across time and in various regions of the world. The American Bobtail can be traced back to Yodi, a cat with the mutation that was found in Arizona in the 1960s. Yodi passed the genetic quirk on to his kittens, thus creating a new breed.
```
