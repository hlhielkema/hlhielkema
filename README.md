**🐈 Cat fact of the day:**
```
The Australian Wildlife Conservancy completed a 44km cat-proof fence in 2018 to prevent feral cats from entering the Newhaven wildlife sanctuary, who kill about a million native birds every night across Australia and have caused the extinction of 20 native species.
```
