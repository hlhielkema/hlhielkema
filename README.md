**🐈 Cat fact of the day:**
```
If you grow your own catnip, here's how to prepare it for kitty's enjoyment: Cut several stalks of the plant from the base. Hang them upside down in a dark and dry room for several weeks. Then cut the catnip into small pieces, rub some on your cat's favorite toys or scratching post, and let the games begin!
```
